#import important libraries
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as soup  #Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
from urllib.request import urlopen as Ureq #urllib is a package that collects several modules for working with URLs.

#first load the url as here i used flipkart dell laptops url

uclient = Ureq(url)  # open url and store it into uclient
page = uclient.read()  #read url data and store into page

#This module defines a class HTMLParser which serves as the basis for parsing text files formatted in HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language) and XHTML.
